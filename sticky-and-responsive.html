  <h3>Features Sticky, Pulldowns and Responsive</h3>
  <p><img src="Donna-N-Dave-LakeshoreDr-Moon.jpeg" alt="Donna and Dave" title="onna and Dave" class="alignleft size-medium" height="300" width="225"/> 
    <strong>OUR STORY TOGETHER</strong> continues with us in a beautiful neighborhood on the shore of Lake Michigan in Manitowoc, Wisconsin  
    after living in Green Valley, Arizona and Denver, Colorado for most our lives. Getting here probably 
    started to happen as we traveled the summer of 2015 to our summer cabin in Sterling, Alaska.</p>
     
  <p>Donna and I lived in Colorado for most of our adult-lives, until moving to We have to admit living with 23,000 other retired 
    people gets old, thus we welcomed the 10 day trips to and from Alaska. I'd traveled to and purchased considerable un-developed 
    properties in Sterling between 2005 and 2008. Donna hadn't been there since we re-connected in 2011 - 2013 timeframe, 
    so it was a welcome trip.</p>

  <p>The Alaska adventures started for me (Dave) in 1996 - 1998 with two jobs up there. The 2nd one took me to Anchorage, Alaska 
    as a project manager on a telecom billing system conversion for 5 months (June - October). While there in 1998 fishing took 
    control of my off-times, and eventually wondered down to the Kenai Peninsula to fish Salmon on the Kenai River.</p>

  <p>In 2012 nearing retirement and still in Colorado, I purchased a retirement home in Green Valley, Arizona (some of my family 
    lived there at the time) and also focused on completing the cabin in Alaska and selling land.</p>
    
  <p>Back to Donna and Dave. Prior to 2013 we'd lived separate lives since meeting in 1986. However, in 2013 we finally got together 
    for good. Donna was also reaching her retirement age. Unfortunately with both of us retiring, living in Colorado 
    was out-of-the-question economically. So off to Arizona we headed on November 5th, 2013.
  </p>

  <p>Looking back from 2022, if we had it to do again we likely would have abandon Arizona and moved to Grand 
    Junction, Colorado. Actually we did try that around 2016 and 2017, but Colorado real estate on the Western 
  Slope had aready gotten too far out-of-reach. Another real problem we quality healthcare and Medicare Providers. </p>

  <p><h2>Focus Of Github Wiki Pages</h2>
  <strong>PHP and teaching people how to Fish!</strong> Free Apps (like on Github) generally require some teaching before 
  average Wordpressers can benefit. Therefore, in keeping with the open source model that's what I am going to do  
  via Github Pages, etc.</p>

  <h2>Next Up - Sticky Header and Responsive Design Website</h2>
  <p>Right now (Nov 11th, 2022) this undertaking has not been a walk-in-the-park and it is not fully ready for Prime-Time. 
    This website does have a version of Sticky and Responsive running here, but I am not ready to release a 
    HOW-TO on the subject.
  </p>
  <h2>Apps</h2>
  <p>Below is a simple table that talks about Apps I have written over the last few years 
  and deployed at the Wood Workers of Green Valley Recreation in Green Valley, Arizona. Currently I have also 
  completed a Paypal IPN App, which now is in a refinement mode (BTW, it has been tested live on one site).</p>
