** CRITICAL NOTE ******************************************
    Must edit myshopper-newpage.html
    (duplicated from NOW NAMED PAGE github-myshopper-newpage.html)
    to change URL of the last line to reflect:
    <div w3-include-html="github-my-file-upload-content.html"></div>
    THIS IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX-LOOKING & EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
***********************************************************
     
ABOUT LOCAL & GITHUB REPOSITORIES:
