<h2>Welcome to Manitowoc and Lake Michigan</h2>

<strong>THIS STORY</strong> starts with us in a beautiful neighborhood on the shore of Lake Michigan in Manitowoc, Wisconsin  
after living in Green Valley, Arizona and Denver, Colorado for most our lives. Getting here probably 
started to happen as we traveled to 
our summer cabin in Sterling, Alaska in 2015. We have to admit it, living with 23,000 other retired 
people had already gotten old, so we welcomed the 10 day trips to and from Alaska. 
I'd traveled to and purchased considerable vacant 
vacation properties in Sterling and Donna hadn't been there since we re-connected in 2011 - 2013 timeframe. 
The Alaska adventures start for me (Dave) in 1996 - 1998 with two jobs up there. The 2nd one took me to 
Anchorage, Alaska as a project manager on a telecom billing system conversion for 5 months (June - October). 
While there in 1998 fishing 
took control of my off-times, and eventually wondered down to the Kenai Peninsula to fish Salmon on the Kenai 
River. Donna and I lived in Colorado for most of our adult-lives. In 2013, nearing retirement, we 
  purchased a retirement home in Green Valley, Arizona (some of my family lived there at the time). 
Prior to retirement we lived separate lives until meeting in 1986, but we already had other lives, so 
time our lives together had to wait. Finally in 2013 we again got together, and this time for good.

<h2>Github Wiki Pages</h2>
<p><strong>Teaching people how to Fish</strong> My mission is teaching what I have learned during my 
35 year career in computer software, and Github.Com is my selected means of doing it. Got it! 
So very little will be said here except "Everything to say what I have is free on Github.Com/dva1946. 
That said, if you are interested and have the desire and basic skills to learn, visit my App downloads 
on Github.Com/dva1946. As these two site progress, more knowledge will be shared. Dave</p>
<h2>Content Formatting</h2>
<p>A more uniform look-n-feel is forthcoming. Unfortunately Github Wiki Pages are generally done in 
  good ole fashion HTML, unless you want to learn another App.
</p> 
<h2>Apps</h2>
<p>Below is a simple table that talks about Apps I have written over the last few years 
and deployed at the Wood Workers of Green Valley Recreation in Green Valley, Arizona.</p>
