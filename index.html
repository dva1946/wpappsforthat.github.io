    <h1>Dave Van Abel Github Pages</h1>

<p><strong>Donna & Dave</strong> Welcome to a beautiful moonlit overview evening 
of Lake Michigan October 29, 2021.</p>

</p><img src="Donna-N-Dave-LakeshoreDr-Moon.jpeg" 
alt="Donna and Dave" style="width:360px;height:480px;margin-right:10px;"><strong>OUR STORY</strong>: This is our last retirement destination neighborhood, after living in Green Valley, 
Arizona and Denver, Colorado for most our lives. Getting here probably started to happen as we traveled to 
our summer cabin in Sterling, Alaska the summer of 2015. I'd traveled to and purchased considerable vacant 
vacation properties in Sterling and Donna hadn't been there since we re-connected in 2011 - 2013 timeframe. 
The Alaska adventures start for me (Dave) in 1996 - 1998 with two jobs up there. The 2nd one took me to 
Anchorage, Alaska as a project manager on a telecom billing system conversion. While there in 1998 fishing 
took control of my off-times, and eventually wondered down to the Kenai Peninsula to fish Salmon on the Kenai 
River. Donna and I lived in Colorado for most of our adult-lives. In 2013, nearing retirement, we 
  purchased a retirement home in Green Valley, Arizona (some of my family lived there at the time). 
Prior to retirement we lived separate lives until meeting in 1986, but we already had other lives, so 
time our lives together had to wait. Finally in 2013 we again got together, and this time for good.

<h2>Github Wiki Pages</h2>
I am using the free version of Github.Com and therefore also using the free version of 
Github Wiki Pages. Being free there is one big restriction: It is not a place to advertize 
your wears for sale. Got it! So very little will be said here except "Everything on 
Github.Com/dva1946 is free" and my entire focust is to Teach people how to Fish. I already 
know how to fish (here and Salmon in Alaska), so there is nothing to be gained here for me.
<h2>Apps</h2>
Below is a simple table that talks about Apps I have written over the last few years 
and deployed at the Wood Workers of Green Valley Recreation in Green Valley, Arizona.
