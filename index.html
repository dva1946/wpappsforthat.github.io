<h2>Welcome to Manitowoc and Lake Michigan</h2>

<strong>THIS STORY</strong> starts with us in a beautiful neighborhood on the shore of Lake Michigan in Manitowoc, Wisconsin  
after living in Green Valley, Arizona and Denver, Colorado for most our lives. Getting here probably 
started to happen as we traveled to our summer cabin in Sterling, Alaska in 2015. 
We have to admit living with 23,000 other retired people gets old, thus we welcomed the 10 day trips to and from Alaska. 
I'd traveled to and purchased considerable un-developed properties in Sterling and Donna hadn't been there since we 
re-connected in 2011 - 2013 timeframe. The Alaska adventures start for me (Dave) in 1996 - 1998 with two jobs up there. 
The 2nd one took me to Anchorage, Alaska as a project manager on a telecom billing system conversion for 5 months (June - October). 
While there in 1998 fishing 
took control of my off-times, and eventually wondered down to the Kenai Peninsula to fish Salmon on the Kenai 
River. Donna and I lived in Colorado for most of our adult-lives. In 2013, nearing retirement, we 
 purchased a retirement home in Green Valley, Arizona (some of my family lived there at the time). 
Prior to retirement we lived separate lives until meeting in 1986, but we already had other lives, so 
time our lives together had to wait. Finally in 2013 we again got together, and this time for good.

<h2>Github Wiki Pages</h2>
<p><strong>Teaching people how to Fish!</strong> Free Apps (like on Github) generally require some teaching before 
average Wordpressers can benifit. Therefore, in keeping with the open source model that's what I am going to do  
via Github Pages and other social media platforms.</p>
<h2>Site Formatting</h2>
<p>Github Pages does not have a fancy web interface like Wordpress. Therefore, everything needs to be build 
  from the ground up. It has a good start and it will improve in the coming months. If not, blame it on retirement.

<h2>Apps</h2>
<p>Below is a simple table that talks about Apps I have written over the last few years 
and deployed at the Wood Workers of Green Valley Recreation in Green Valley, Arizona.</p>
