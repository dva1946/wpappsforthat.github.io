      <strong>THIS STORY</strong> starts with us in a beautiful neighborhood on the shore of Lake Michigan in Manitowoc, Wisconsin  
      after living in Green Valley, Arizona and Denver, Colorado for most our lives. Getting here probably 
      started to happen as we traveled the summer of 2015 to our summer cabin in Sterling, Alaska.</p>
       
    <p>Donna and I lived in Colorado for most of our adult-lives, until moving to We have to admit living with 23,000 other retired 
      people gets old, thus we welcomed the 10 day trips to and from Alaska. I'd traveled to and purchased considerable un-developed 
      properties in Sterling between 2005 and 2008. Donna hadn't been there since we re-connected in 2011 - 2013 timeframe, 
      so it was a welcome trip.</p>

    <p>The Alaska adventures started for me (Dave) in 1996 - 1998 with two jobs up there. The 2nd one took me to Anchorage, Alaska 
      as a project manager on a telecom billing system conversion for 5 months (June - October). While there in 1998 fishing took 
      control of my off-times, and eventually wondered down to the Kenai Peninsula to fish Salmon on the Kenai River.</p>

    <p>In 2012 nearing retirement and still in Colorado, I purchased a retirement home in Green Valley, Arizona (some of my family 
      lived there at the time) and also focused on completing the cabin in Alaska and selling land.</p>
      
      Back to Donna and Dave. Prior to 2013 we'd lived separate lives since meeting in 1986. However, in 2013 we finally got together 
      for good. Donna was also reaching her retirement age. Unfortunately with both of us retiring, living in Colorado 
      was out-of-the-question economically. So off to Arizona we headed on November 5th, 2013.

    <p><h2>Github Wiki Pages</h2>
    <strong>Teaching people how to Fish!</strong> Free Apps (like on Github) generally require some teaching before 
    average Wordpressers can benefit. Therefore, in keeping with the open source model that's what I am going to do  
    via Github Pages and other social media platforms.</p>

    <h2>Next New Site Feature - All-In-One Header!</h2>
    <p>No web tools, so what I have <a href="https://W3Schools.Com" target="_blank">W3schools.Com!</a>. In the last 
      few days I have learned how to 1) Write around an image, 2) Build menus, 3) Make menus responsive and 4) Sticky Menus.
    </p> 

    <h2>Apps</h2>
    <p>Below is a simple table that talks about Apps I have written over the last few years 
    and deployed at the Wood Workers of Green Valley Recreation in Green Valley, Arizona. Currently I have also 
    completed a Paypal IPN App, which now is in a refinement mode (BTW, it has been tested live on one site).</p>
