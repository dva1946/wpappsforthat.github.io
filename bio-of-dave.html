<h1>Bio of Dave Van Abel</h1>
   
<p><b>A Civil Engineer by education</b> who wondered into Applications Development in the mid 1980s, and worked there until retirement in 2013. However, I still dabble in front-end WordPress app development.
</p>
<p><b>Data processing</b> was my favorite type of application development, specifically telephone billing in the 80â€™s and early 90s. The last big project was data processing design-develop in a successful $31M Class-Action Law suit case (settled around 2010-2011).
</p>
<p><b>Around 2000</b> I entered web development using Perl and open source databases. My work also included a software team in Romania. Somewhere after 2010 I discovered WordPress, while working in the Corporate world.
</p>
<p><b>In 2015 and 2016</b> I created two club websites in WordPress. However. after many frustration years with plugins, it became obvious the best solution was Learn Now To Write Front-End Apps for WordPress. Mission tackled and accomplished in 2019 and 2020. Now it is time to pass on this knowledge.
</p>
<p><b>If you are inspired</b> and have some required skills, it is probably time for you to dip your toes in the water. Apps which you can download from this site and some of my HowTos should get you started and eventually successful! Most of all HAVE FUN!
</p>
<p><b>PS</b>: Fall 2022 now writing WpApps again mainly for one client and teaching people how to fish via Github.Com.
