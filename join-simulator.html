<p>This is a the basic PHP script with a bit of HTML. I am not here to teach 101 Anything like:
    PHP, MySQL, HTML or CSS. However included some styling. Separate file(s) for CSS will be included, 
    and some Custom CSS that can (likely) can be included in your theme.</p>
    
    <p>If you need to learn about PHP, Database, SQL, CSS or HTML your best should GOOGLE. 
    Additionally, throughout my series of Apps you will see extensive PHP code plus good Queries.</p>
    
    <p>So my contribution to teaching is within the Apps.</p>
    
    <p>PHP code is written in as PROCEDURAL, not OOP (Object Orientated) because it is simpler and 
    very good for sharing. Most Apps have ample comments.</p>
    
    <p>Apps will be released in order of complexity (with a few exceptions), so people can advance their
    skills progressively.</p>
    
    <p>While learning how to build Apps, seldom did I find complete Apps. I will try to provide complete Apps,
    which includes database table definitions complete with loadable schemas in SQL format, so you can import
    to your Wordpress database.</p> 
    
    <p>Hopefully what I have and am providing will get you started.</p>
