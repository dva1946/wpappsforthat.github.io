              PHP code is written in as PROCEDURAL, not OOP (Object Orientated) because it is simpler and 
              very good for sharing. Most Apps have ample comments.

              Apps will be released in order of complexity (with a few exceptions), so people can advance their
              skills progressively.

              This is a the basic PHP script with a bit of HTML. I am not here to teach 101 Anything like:
              PHP, MySQL, HTML or CSS. However included some styling. Separate file(s) for CSS will be included, 
              and some Custom CSS that can (likely) can be included in your theme.

              While learning how to build Apps, seldom did I find complete Apps. I will try to provide complete Apps,
              which includes database table definitions complete with loadable schemas in SQL format, so you can import
              to your Wordpress database.
