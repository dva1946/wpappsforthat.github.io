    <p><strong>THIS STORY</strong> starts with us in a beautiful neighborhood on the shore of Lake Michigan in Manitowoc, Wisconsin  
      after living in Green Valley, Arizona and Denver, Colorado for most our lives. Getting here probably 
      started to happen as we traveled to our summer cabin in Sterling, Alaska in 2015. <img src="Donna-N-Dave-LakeshoreDr-Moon.jpeg"

    We have to admit living with 23,000 other retired people gets old, thus we welcomed the 10 day trips to and from Alaska. 
    I'd traveled to and purchased considerable un-developed properties in Sterling and Donna hadn't been there since we 
    re-connected in 2011 - 2013 timeframe.</p>

    <p>The Alaska adventures start for me (Dave) in 1996 - 1998 with two jobs up there. 
    The 2nd one took me to Anchorage, Alaska as a project manager on a telecom billing system conversion for 5 months (June - October). 
    While there in 1998 fishing took control of my off-times, and eventually wondered down to the Kenai Peninsula to fish Salmon on the Kenai 
    River. Donna and I lived in Colorado for most of our adult-lives.</p>

    <p>In 2013, nearing retirement, we purchased a retirement home in Green Valley, Arizona (some of my family lived there at the time). 
    Prior to retirement we lived separate lives until meeting in 1986, but we already had other lives, so 
    time our lives together had to wait. Finally in 2013 we again got together, and this time for good.

    <h2>Github Wiki Pages</h2>
    <p><strong>Teaching people how to Fish!</strong> Free Apps (like on Github) generally require some teaching before 
    average Wordpressers can benefit. Therefore, in keeping with the open source model that's what I am going to do  
    via Github Pages and other social media platforms.</p>
    <h2>Next New Site Feature - All-In-One Header!</h2>
    <p>No web tools, so what I have <a href="https://W3Schools.Com" target="_blank">W3schools.Com!</a>. In the last 
      few days I have learned how to 1) Write around an image, 2) Build menus, 3) Make menus responsive and 4) Sticky Menus.
