    <p><strong>Welcome</strong> to the peaceful neighborhood on the shore of 
        Lake Michigan in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.</p>   
      
    
    <h2>MyShopper Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Concept of MyShopper</strong> comes from using a popular Grocery Shopping List 
    for three years. It has a 4.9 rating from 70,000 reviews. It is loaded with features, 
    bells and whistles, yet missing (or hidden within its settings) are two very critical 
    features to be rated excellent: Unique item names and store location, nothing else 
    matters if you can't quickly get it. Thus the birth of MyShopper for WordPress 
    by WpAppsForThat.Com.</p>
