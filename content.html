    <h3>Features Sticky, Pulldowns and Responsive</h3>
    <p>Just like the fancy themes in Wordpress, except this is all written in html, css and javascript.</p>
    
    <p>My next job is to consolidate CSS and create an INCLUDE. Then every page can have this menu,
      until them I have to buid them one-by-one.</p>
    <p>Content below is to enable full page scrolling. So I am adding some photos for fun. <strong>Wilson St and S 9th St</strong> in Manitowoc, WI is where we live now. Laughing a bit, this home was built about 1955, so it is no great upgrade 
      from the 1951 version in Hollandtown. I have to say that is false and true, considering the condition when we got it February 1st, 2021.
  <img src="WilsonStOnTheLake.jpg" alt="Wilson and 9th by the lake" style="width:225px;height:300px;margin-right:10px;"> All this is true: 
  All exterion doors & storm had to be replaced, it had not been maintained for 25-30 years, all stormwindows needed refurbishing, trees needed to come down 
  and now the furnace + ducting is being replaced. Oh ya, I put in three windows to replace a 4' x 8' window set that could not stop any cold or hot weather. 
  Aside from the basement didn't leak and most appliances worked, it was like our home in Hollandtown.
