    <p><strong>Concept of MyShopper</strong> comes from using a popular <u>Grocery Shopping List</u> for three years. 
        It has a 4.9 rating from 70,000 reviews. It is loaded with features, 
        bells and whistles, yet missing (or hidden within its settings) are 
        two very critical features to be rated excellent: Unique item names 
        and store location, nothing else matters if you canâ€™t quickly get it. 
        Thus the birth of MyShopper for WordPress by WpAppsForThat.Com.
