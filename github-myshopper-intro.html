    <p><strong>Concept of MyShopper</strong> comes from using a popular <u>Grocery Shopping List</u> for three years. 
        It has a 4.9 rating from 70,000 reviews. It is loaded with features, 
        bells and whistles, yet missing (or hidden within its settings) are 
        two very critical features to be rated excellent: Unique item names 
        and store location, nothing else matters if you canâ€™t quickly get it. 
        Thus the birth of MyShopper for WordPress by WpAppsForThat.Com.

    <p>The Alaska adventures start for me (Dave) in 1996 - 1998 with two jobs up there. 
    The 2nd one took me to Anchorage, Alaska as a project manager on a telecom billing system conversion for 5 months (June - October). 
    While there in 1998 fishing took control of my off-times, and eventually wondered down to the Kenai Peninsula to fish Salmon on the Kenai 
    River. Donna and I lived in Colorado for most of our adult-lives.</p>

    <p>In 2013, nearing retirement, we purchased a retirement home in Green Valley, Arizona (some of my family lived there at the time). 
    Prior to retirement we lived separate lives until meeting in 1986, but we already had other lives, so 
    time our lives together had to wait. Finally in 2013 we again got together, and this time for good.
