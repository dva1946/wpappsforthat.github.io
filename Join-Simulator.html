    This is a the basic PHP script with a bit of HTML. I am not here to teach 101 Anything like:
    PHP, MySQL, HTML or CSS. However included some styling. Separate file(s) for CSS will be included, 
    and some Custom CSS that can (likely) can be included in your theme.
    
    If you need to learn about PHP, Database, SQL, CSS or HTML your best should GOOGLE. 
    Additionally, throughout my series of Apps you will see extensive PHP code plus good Queries.
    
    So my contribution to teaching is within the Apps.
    
    PHP code is written in as PROCEDURAL, not OOP (Object Orientated) because it is simpler and 
    very good for sharing. Most Apps have ample comments.
    
    Apps will be released in order of complexity (with a few exceptions), so people can advance their
    skills progressively.
    
    While learning how to build Apps, seldom did I find complete Apps. I will try to provide complete Apps,
    which includes database table definitions complete with loadable schemas in SQL format, so you can import
    to your Wordpress database. 
    
    Hopefully what I have and am providing will get you started.
